# Workflow to build and publish the libzim ASM and WASM arttefacts together with the JavaScript wrapper.
# If this workflow is triggered by the creation of a draft release, then the artefacts are uploaded to the release assets.
# If it is triggered by a push or pull request to master, or manually, then the artefacts are archived under the corresponding Action.
